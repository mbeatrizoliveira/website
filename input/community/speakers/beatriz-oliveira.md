An entrepreneur, speaker, and visionary in the web design industry, Beatriz Oliveira is the founder and CEO of BindTuning, one of the leading platforms for building connected and engaging workplaces for Microsoft Teams, Office 365, and SharePoint. After a serious accident in 2008, Beatriz used her recovery doing what she loves best - creating and selling themes on DotNetNuke. Her designs quickly became top sellers. This fortuitous success led to her "aha" moment - conceptualizing "skin tuning" and extending the tool to a dozen other platforms. BindTuning was born in 2011.
For the past 15 years, Beatriz has been a speaker at numerous international events.

Prior to BindTuning, Beatriz was a founder of CentralBiz, a successful development company where she spent 4 years as a Creative Director.

Beatriz graduated top of her class in IT Engineering and completed her master's in Design and Communication. She is actively involved in STEM education for youth, hosting monthly coding events for children in the BindTuning offices. She is also an ardent supporter of diversity in technology. A Microsoft Regional Director, MVP, and Certified Professional, Beatriz is currently the President of IAMCP Portugal. She resides in Porto, Portugal.
